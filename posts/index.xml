      <title>Site migration</title>

      <description>I recently migrated this site from a WordPress website. The migration wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect so there are some issues with image proportions and perhaps other issues as well.
I am aware that the site title on mobile devices is not displaying properly. Unfortunately it will probably have to wait until the theme is updated or I install a new theme.</description>

      <description>So basically I use WordPress on my phone as a primary component of my eBay listing workflow. However the latest version of wordpress has some issues which make it not work very well in my workflow. so because I had backed up an earlier good version of wordpress using titanium backup I decided to try to restore it. However that didn’t work at first and a number of other things I tried it didn’t work.</description>

      <description>Stay away from these batteries. I bought them on eBay. I only used them a few times before they would hold hardly any charge and I have now thrown many of them away.
They are much lighter in weight than what you would expect. I have a theory (but no proof) that they are partly alkaline batteries so maybe they work initially, but they don’t keep working after many recharges.</description>

      <description>I had a macrodroid macro set up where it would start an app and wait for a few seconds then start another app. However the macro wasn’t working. What solved the issue for me was going in to the Android settings and giving macrodroid the permission to start in the background.</description>

      <description>I tried a free game called Triggore. It is an appropriate game for October because it is a horror survival type of game. You start off the game in a dark house and your goal is to survive a night filled with horrifying creatures breaking in and attacking. It feels very much like a Halloween game.
Unfortunately, the game was too hard for me and I wasn’t able to survive for more than a few minutes.</description>

      <description>I recently bought a Heal Force PC-80B ECG monitor which comes with software for Windows. However, rather than having to reboot into Windows I wanted to see if I could use it in Linux. It turns out it actually works fairly well in Ubuntu 18.04. It installs using wine without any problems. The specific version of the ECG Viewer Manager I’m using is V5.2.0.2. The only thing that hasn’t worked for me so far is the “Import Device Data” tool.</description>

      <description>download this file and put it somewhere convenient
paste_image_into_directory.sh rename the file to “paste_image_into_directory.sh”
make sure you have the nautilus FileManager Actions software installed as well as xclip
In FileManager Actions create an entry that looks like this:
In “Parameters” put “location/to/file.sh” %f
To use the script, right click on a directory in nautilus and then select your FileManager action</description>

I tried to get the latest version of electrum and this is what I found. Two pieces of antivirus software found malware in electrum. It is a shame because electrum was such a good piece of software.</description>

Layer effects and other nondestructive editing should make Gimp a viable alternative for the majority of people who are using Photoshop now.</description>

      <description>I bought NVIDIA GTX 960 a year or so ago eBay. Unfortunately it has given me nothing but problems. The graphics driver doesn’t work and the performance is pretty poor. You can see from the photos below that the logo does not look like a legitimate Nvidia logo. The color should be green but instead it is yellow. Most likely it is a knock off graphics card made to look like a GTX 960.</description>

      <description>The UI of course could use some improvement (perhaps split windows based on where the crease is). Typing on this thing probably isn’t fun right now. The keyboard could use some feedback for the user. Perhaps a subtle electrical field so that the user has an idea of where the keys are. The field doesn’t have to be involved for every key. Think about how static electricity feels. You can feel the charge in your fingers.</description>

      <description>The reason I switched isn’t that godot is better but because it runs much better on my computer. I have an older laptop and unity just runs poorly on it. Unity is slow on my laptop and takes up a large portion of the RAM. I can barely have a browser open at the same time. In addition, Unity is optimized for screens that are much larger or multi monitor setups.</description>

      <description>It is in the best interests of post office workers to process as little mail as possible. Enough mail so that their branch doesn’t get shut down, but no more. How can this be changed so that the interests of the post office workers and the post office customers are more in alignment. Perhaps the workers can be paid partly on commission so that the more they ship the more they get paid.</description>

      <description>There is a need for public areas to take naps, places that aren’t in the home. For example there could be a small area of the library or maybe a universities could have areas, etc. Of course there is a risk of people’s items getting stolen when they are sleeping so maybe there could be some small lockers near the sleeping area. In order to be sanitary people could bring their own small and lightweight sheet and lay it on top of the sleeping pad.</description>

      <description>I want to live in a world where people don’t have to suffer if they don’t choose to, they don’t have to go hungry, they don’t have to force themselves to work if it causes them physical pain. however I also want to live in a world where the tax rate is reasonable, where people don’t feel like they are wage slaves to the government. I believe it is possible to reach a reasonable compromise between these two positions, but it may only be sustainable if people are willing to give up some of their reproductive rights.</description>

      <description>why don’t we minimize the qualifications needed for becoming something like a surgeon rather than maximizing them like we do now. why does someone have to go through many years of schooling to become a surgeon? why can’t the licensing just be limited to the basic requirements that would be needed in order to keep patients safe. Things like making sure they know sterile procedure and that they can identify parts of the body that if they cut could cause problems or death.</description>
