				<p>I want to live in a world where people don’t have to suffer if they don’t choose to, they don’t have to go hungry, they don’t have to force themselves to work if it causes them physical pain. however I also want to live in a world where the tax rate is reasonable, where people don’t feel like they are wage slaves to the government. I believe it is possible to reach a reasonable compromise between these two positions, but it may only be sustainable if people are willing to give up some of their reproductive rights. Specifically the right to have children while they are receiving significant government benefits. Of course they would be free to not receive the benefits and to have as many children as they wish and a number of people would choose to do this and that’s fine. however if something like a universal basic income is to be sustainable I believe that is it likely that people will need to give up some of their reproductive rights while they are receiving it.</p>
