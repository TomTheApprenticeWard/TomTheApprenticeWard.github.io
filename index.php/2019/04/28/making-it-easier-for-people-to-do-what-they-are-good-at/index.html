				<p>why don’t we minimize the qualifications needed for becoming something like a surgeon rather than maximizing them like we do now. why does someone have to go through many years of schooling to become a surgeon? why can’t the licensing just be limited to the basic requirements that would be needed in order to keep patients safe. Things like making sure they know sterile procedure and that they can identify parts of the body that if they cut could cause problems or death. They could learn these things in a few days of classes and tests rather than the years it takes now. of course their skills would be very limited at first but they could expand them over time if they wanted to and at least they could spend their time and effort doing whatever they excel at rather than spending so much energy on other things they probably aren’t interested in and probably aren’t that great at.</p>
